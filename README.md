# On This Date

A web application that allow users to enter their birthday date to get information such as weather, moon phrase, born on this day, died on this day, random facts, astrology and numerology information. Using multiple APIs to give you the information about your special day.

# Motivation

A few of our teammates was into florida man memes so we were thinking about creating a webapp that will give us specific "florida man memes" for that specific date. All of us were throwing out ideas so we decided to go with users input birthday date and we can give them all cool and unique information for that specific date.

Since birthday comes once a year, it's a momentous occasion and to be commemorates and celebrates in many way. Your birthday is a chance to remember the day that a major event occured. Therefore, we want to give thanks and give you insights that can be funny and useful for your very special day.
